<p> The part-Spanish, part-Luxembourgish artist has cultivated her skill and selection process in Amsterdam’s after-hour scene. Now residing in Berlin, her rhythms find inspiration in the eclectic and somewhat wilder characteristics of the city. Not bound to a sound in particular, Ogazón is best in arranging a coherent thread of feelings throughout her sets, be it melancholic bliss, ecstatic hope or just pure dancefloor pleasure.</p>
